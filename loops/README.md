# Loops in HLS

## Structure of this example

* `Makefile` with the different commands to run the different steps of the workflow (simulation, synthesis, etc)
* `run_hls.tcl`: TCL script to create the Vitis HLS project and add the files to it
* `src` folder with the source files for the code to be synthesized and the testbench
  * `func.h`, `func.cc`: header and source file for the code to be synthesized
  * `testbench.cc`: source file for the testbench with random input generation and output checking

## Running the example (Makefile)

`make` will run the whole workflow (simulation, synthesis, etc) and generate the reports in the `proj/solution/syn/report` folder.

## Running the example (command line without Makefile)

### Create the Vitis HLS project

`vitis_hls -f run_hls.tcl`

## Open the project in the GUI

After creating the project using the tcl script (default name from script is `proj`)

`vitis_hls -p proj`
